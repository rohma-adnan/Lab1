    <h1><strong>Fun Fact About Galaxies</strong></h1>

    <dt><b>Most Distant Galaxy:</b></dt>
    <dd>The most distant galaxy ever discovered is GN-z11, located over 13 billion light-years away. It formed only 400
        million years after the Big Bang, making it one of the oldest galaxies we can observe!</dd> <br>

    <dt><b>Galaxies Collide!:</b></dt>
    <dd>Our Milky Way galaxy is on a collision course with the Andromeda galaxy. In about 4.5 billion years, the two
        will collide, merging into a new, larger galaxy. But don't worryâ€”star collisions are unlikely!</dd><br>

    <dt><b>Rogue Galaxies:</b></dt>
    <dd>There are galaxies called "rogue galaxies" that have been ejected from their original clusters and drift freely
        through space. They have no gravitational ties to any larger structures!</dd><br>

    <dt><b>The Largest Galaxy:</b></dt>
    <dd>The largest galaxy known is IC 1101, which is about 6 million light-years in diameter. That's roughly 60 times
        the size of the Milky Way!</dd> <br>

    <h2>Types of Galaxies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Spiral</strong> Disk-shaped with arms (like the Milky Way)</li>
        <li><strong>Elliptical</strong> Round or oval, mostly old stars</li>
        <li><strong>Irregular</strong>No clear shape, messy and chaotic</li>
        <li><strong>Barred Spiral</strong> Spiral with a central bar (Milky Way too!)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here is an interesting fact about galaxies:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i><b>"Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, held together by gravity."</b></i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Isn't that amazing?</p>
